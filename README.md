# T-Rex
A desktop game inspired by the classic Chrome T-Rex using Windows Forms and C#. Implemented jump and crouch mechanics, character animation, collision detection via hitboxes, dynamic background scrolling, obstacle generation, and a scoring system. Integrated sound effects and a custom pixel font. The project showcases skills in graphics rendering (GDI+), keyboard event handling, and optimized drawing with double buffering.
